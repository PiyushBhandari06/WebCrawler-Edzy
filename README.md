#IMPORTANT NOTES :<br>

1. I have not added console logs for the API calls yet; I can add them if required. Please let me know if you would like that.<br>

2. I have added detailed console logs for both the /crawl API and the npm run crawl script to clearly indicate execution stages and progress, including logs during the incoming-links build process.<br>

3. I have implemented all the requested changes. I apologize for not updating the GitHub repository simultaneously.<br>

4. I have also made some updates to route URLs and npm scripts, so please take those changes into consideration as well.<br>
